# passkeys

Living truth for WebAuthn registration and assertion (access level
A3) on `identikey-server`, stored as `credentials` rows in
`identikey-keys`. Folded from `add-passkey-ceremonies` (2026-08-20)
and `add-hosted-login-ui` (2026-08-27).

RP ID and expected origins are fail-closed at boot (`62j`). Related
origins are already served (`2js`). Nicknames, Signal APIs, and
synced-passkey counter policy are later slices (`5gh.2`–`5gh.4`).

### Requirement: Registration and assertion use webauthn-rs

The system SHALL perform WebAuthn registration and assertion with
`webauthn-rs`, using the fail-closed RP ID and origin allowlist
already parsed at boot. Discoverable (resident) keys SHALL be
**required** so a synced authenticator (1Password, iCloud Keychain,
Google Password Manager) can store the passkey. Creation options
SHALL NOT set `authenticatorAttachment` or `hints` that prefer a
platform authenticator only. A verified assertion SHALL bind to an
existing account XID and SHALL NOT create an account implicitly.

#### Scenario: Registration stores a passkey credential

- GIVEN a stored account and valid registration options
- WHEN attestation verifies
- THEN a `credentials` row of kind passkey exists for that XID

#### Scenario: Unknown user is not created on assertion

- GIVEN no account for the asserted credential
- WHEN assertion is submitted
- THEN the ceremony fails and no account is inserted

### Requirement: Authorization passkey page is a product surface

`GET /authorize/passkey` SHALL return HTML that performs a
usernameless WebAuthn assertion on this origin. It SHALL NOT
present the ceremony options as a raw JSON dump as the only UI.

#### Scenario: Passkey page asks the authenticator

- GIVEN a valid pending authorization
- WHEN the user is sent to `/authorize/passkey`
- THEN the response is `text/html`
- AND the page invokes `navigator.credentials.get`
- AND it does not require a username field

### Requirement: Signup creates a C2 account then a passkey

The host SHALL provide a signup surface that creates a C2 managed
identity and then performs WebAuthn registration. A verified
assertion SHALL still not insert an account.

#### Scenario: Signup stores a passkey

- GIVEN no account
- WHEN signup completes and attestation verifies
- THEN an account row and a passkey credential exist for that XID

#### Scenario: Unknown assertion still creates nothing

- GIVEN no account for the asserted credential
- WHEN assertion is submitted
- THEN the ceremony fails and no account is inserted
